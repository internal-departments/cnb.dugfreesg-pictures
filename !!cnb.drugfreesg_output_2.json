Firstly, these dormitories can be higher-risk environments where substance abuse may go unchecked due to various socio-economic stressors that migrant workers face, such as isolation and difficult working conditions. The operation from December 8 to 11, 2025, suggests a strategic effort to address potential drug abuse problems within this community.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of law enforcement in these areas can create a perception of safety among residents, reinforcing the government's stance on maintaining a drug-free society. However, this approach may also strain community relations if migrant workers feel targeted or stereotyped as drug offenders, potentially leading to feelings of alienation or distrust towards local authorities.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it's crucial for support services to be integrated alongside enforcement operations. Providing resources such as mental health support, recreational activities, and community engagement initiatives can foster a more supportive environment for migrant workers. By prioritizing preventive measures and facilitating open communication, authorities can help balance enforcement with community welfare, ultimately promoting trust and collaboration within the migrant worker community.\n",

This change demonstrated a need for adaptive regulations, as new substances emerged to replace those that were banned or heavily restricted, such as opium. The dialogue in the image indicates the evolving nature of drug abuse, suggesting that while the ban on opium in 1946 was an important milestone, it did not resolve the underlying issues of substance use. \n\nAs people turned to morphine and cannabis, authorities likely faced challenges in monitoring and controlling these substances, prompting the introduction of more comprehensive drug enforcement measures.

The drugs seized are estimated to be worth more than $892,000. The heroin, Ice and cannabis seized could potentially feed the addiction of 2,873 abusers for a week. Some of the areas covered during this island-wide operation included Bedok, Bugis, Bukit Batok, Geylang, Jurong, Sembawang and Yishun. On 13 November, CNB officers launched an operation at a residential unit near Yishun Ring Road which saw the arrest of a 36-year-old Singaporean man for suspected drug-related offences. Cash amounting to SGD5,322.90, MYR442.05, BND155 and THB5 were later seized from the man. CNB officers then searched the man's car, where vape-related products including 304 e-vaporisers and 1,337 e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate were seized. Also on 13 November, CNB officers raided a residential unit near Jurong East Avenue, arresting four Singaporeans, a 53-year-old woman for suspected drug trafficking offences and three men, aged 61, 65 and 67 for suspected drug abuse. About 1,031g of heroin, 131g of Ice, 121g of Ecstasy tablets, one Erimin-5 tablet, drug paraphernalia and cash amounting to SGD6,067 were seized from the unit. Full story .drugfreesg linkinbio",

The boy, wearing a white shirt and blue shorts, innocently asks about the rampant drug use in the past, while the grandfather, in a blue tank top, shares his experience from working at the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB). Nearby, a potted plant adds a touch of greenery, enhancing the homey atmosphere. Below the scene, a historical reference illustrates two men in traditional attire engaged in opium smoking, highlighting a significant chapter in Singapore's history, where opium accounted for 59% of the Straits Settlements' total income in 1904. This harmonious blend of past and present underscores the ongoing efforts against substance abuse in Singapore.",

In the image, the arrangement allows for a clear view of the speaker for all participants, promoting inclusivity and respect for different cultural backgrounds.\n\n2. **Engagement Levels**: The circular or semi-circular setup around a central table fosters interaction, making participants feel more connected and engaged during discussions. This setup can facilitate communication and encourage the sharing of ideas, which is crucial in a collaborative atmosphere like the one described.\n\n3. **Purpose of the Meeting**: Since this session focuses on interactive activities like demonstrations and discussions about drug prevention, the layout encourages participation and allows volunteers to easily observe and engage with the materials and presentations, as highlighted by the individual standing and presenting.\n\n4. **Participant Dynamics**: With a diverse group of volunteers, it's vital to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing. The layout seen in the image suggests an open and inviting space where volunteers can easily see each other, fostering a sense of teamwork and community.\n\n5. **Space Limitations**: The physical space of the meeting room at the CNB may also dictate the arrangement.

Numerous vape-related products including more than 400 e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate, and cash including SGD20,818, RMB498 and MYR5,800 were seized. CNB officers arrested two men (aged 26 and 28) at a void deck of a residential block near Telok Blangah Rise for suspected drug offences, with both suspects physically resisting arrest and had to be subdued by officers. 68 and five e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate were recovered from the 26-year-old and 28-year-old respectively, with preliminary investigations indicating the men were conducting a drug transaction prior to the arrest. The suspects were then escorted to a unit in the same block where two additional men (aged 26 and 23) were arrested, and a search yielded 327 more e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate. Four other Singaporeans were arrested in separate CNB operations the same evening for suspected drug offences. Two men (aged 29 and 32) were arrested near Hougang Avenue 9, with officers seizing vape products and significant cash totalling SGD20,818, RMB498, and MYR5,800 from their unit. At Boon Lay Drive, a 23-year-old man was arrested at his residence where five e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate were found, followed by the arrest of an 18-year-old woman outside the unit who was carrying one etomidate pod and had reportedly planned to collect drugs from the man. Under the MDA, those who import, sell or distribute etomidate-laced e-vaporisers will face prosecution. Investigations into the drug activities of the arrested suspects are ongoing.",
