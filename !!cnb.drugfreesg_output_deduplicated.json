A total of 2,722g of cannabis, with an estimated worth of more than $65,000, was seized from within the unit, and could potentially feed the addiction of 390 abusers for a week. The Singapore Government's stand on illicit drugs, including cannabis, is clear - they are harmful, addictive and can destroy lives, families and communities. CNB would like to remind the public that cannabis is a Class A controlled drug listed under Singapore's Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA). The consumption, possession, trafficking, import or export of any controlled drugs, including cannabis and cannabis products, is an offence under the MDA.

The muted pastel colors\u2014light blue and soft red\u2014add to the calming tone.

        "cleaned_caption": "CNB conducted an operation on 4 January 2025 which saw the seizure of drugs with a total estimated worth of more than $1 million, and the arrests of four Singaporean youths. The seized drugs could potentially feed the addiction of 4,590 drug abusers for a week. Two male suspects aged 27 and 25 were arrested at a carpark near Cassia Crescent, with about 1,855g of heroin, 1,032g of Ice, 98g of Ecstasy tablets and 300 Erimin-5 tablets found on the former, and about 136g of Ice and 21g of cannabis found on the latter. About 11.78kg of cannabis, 1,632g of heroin, 923g of Ice, 877g of ketamine, 234g of Ecstasy tablets and 1,200 Erimin-5 tablets were subsequently recovered from a car which they were arrested next to. The third male suspect (also aged 25), who fled the scene upon witnessing the arrests of the two men, was arrested following a short pursuit. An offensive weapon was seized from him and handed over to the Police. CNB officers recovered about 73g of Ice, 21g of heroin, 20 Erimin-5 tablets and a small amount of Ecstasy tablets upon raiding the residential unit of the 27-year-old suspect in the same vicinity. A 25-year-old female suspected drug abuser was arrested within the unit.

A total of about 2,430g of heroin, 64g of Ice, 723g of cannabis, 9g of ketamine, 38 Ecstasy tablets, 94 Erimin-5 tablets and 2,034 tablets of Tawon Liar believed to contain Tapentadol with an estimated street value of $286,000 - were seized. Locations covered during the operation included Bukit Batok, Hougang, Marsiling, Queenstown and Yishun.In the morning of 29 Nov, a residential unit in the central region of Singapore was raided, where a 60-year-old Singaporean man was seen holding a knife. The man was swiftly subdued by the officers to prevent injury to himself and those around him, and was arrested therein for suspected drug trafficking offences. Forced entry was effected as the man had refused to heed the lawful orders of the officers to open the door. About 2,395g of heroin, 722g of cannabis, 25g of Ice, 44 Erimin-5 tablets and two Ecstasy tablets - with estimated street value of about $273,000 - were seized from within the unit. The amount of heroin, cannabis and Ice seized from within the unit can feed the addiction of about 1,258 abusers for a week.DAC Chang Gim Fook, Deputy Director (Operations) of Intelligence Division, said: The operation on 29 November is an example of the dangers that CNB officers face every day. The suspect was holding a knife, and we had assessed that he could pose a danger to himself and to the officers. Drug traffickers may be armed, increasing the risk to our officers. But this will not deter us. CNB officers are well-trained to handle such situations and managed to safely and effectively subdue the suspect before anyone got hurt.

A total of about 2,430g of heroin, 64g of Ice, 723g of cannabis, 9g of ketamine, 38 Ecstasy tablets, 94 Erimin-5 tablets and 2,034 tablets of Tawon Liar believed to contain Tapentadol with an estimated street value of $286,000 were seized. Locations covered during the operation included Bukit Batok, Hougang, Marsiling, Queenstown and Yishun. In the morning of 29 Nov, a residential unit in the central region of Singapore was raided, where a 60-year-old Singaporean man was seen holding a knife. The man was swiftly subdued by the officers to prevent injury to himself and those around him, and was arrested therein for suspected drug trafficking offences. Forced entry was effected as the man had refused to heed the lawful orders of the officers to open the door. About 2,395g of heroin, 722g of cannabis, 25g of Ice, 44 Erimin-5 tablets and two Ecstasy tablets - with an estimated street value of about $273,000 - were seized from within the unit. The amount of heroin, cannabis and Ice seized from within the unit can feed the addiction of about 1,258 abusers for a week. DAC of Intelligence Division said: The operation on 29 November is an example of the dangers that CNB officers face every day. The suspect was holding a knife, and we had assessed that he could pose a danger to himself and to the officers. Drug traffickers may be armed, increasing the risk to our officers. But this will not deter us. CNB officers are well-trained to handle such situations and managed to safely and effectively subdue the suspect before anyone got hurt. The swift action of the team allowed us to disrupt the supply of illicit drugs that could otherwise pose great harm to Singapore. Investigations into all arrested suspects are ongoing.

        "generated_caption": "A stainless steel knife, glistening with droplets of moisture, lies prominently on a table alongside a stack of newspapers. The blade, which reflects light, is bolstered by a solid metallic handle, indicative of its potential use in domestic kitchen tasks. Beneath this weapon, the newspapers bear a mix of Chinese and English text, likely related to local events, though their specific content remains indistinguishable. The scene, set against a backdrop devoid of people, captures the aftermath of a significant police operation in Singapore. On 29 November, a 60-year-old Singaporean man was apprehended in a residential unit after being found in possession of the knife during an operation targeting drug trafficking. This arrest is part of a broader crackdown where 54 suspects were taken into custody."

Her expression conveys deep sorrow, symbolizing the emotional turmoil often faced by families impacted by drug addiction. The background suggests a domestic setting, enhancing the personal nature of her struggle. Accompanying the image are impactful quotes about loss and realization, reflecting a mother's wish for her son to be free from the grips of substance abuse.

She stands in front of the interior of a home, depicting a somber atmosphere, symbolizing the impact of addiction on family dynamics. A man, presumably her father, faces away from her, symbolizing emotional distance; his attire includes a white shirt and blue trousers. The scene is set against a backdrop of a simple, sparsely furnished room, indicated by a single chair and muted colors.\n\nThe caption reveals the heart-wrenching narrative of a family torn apart by drug addiction. The child yearns for her father to overcome his struggles, highlighting the heavy burden placed on her mother, who has taken on the role of the sole breadwinner. This emphasizes the broader societal issue of drug addiction in Singapore, drawing attention to the need for preventive education and support systems to preserve familial bonds. Overall, no additional people are visible, intensifying the focus on the child and her father\u2019s absence."

        "generated_caption": "In a recent interview, a member of the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) emphasized the urgent need for parents and educators in Singapore to enhance drug awareness among youths. Recent statistics reveal troubling trends: more youths are being arrested for drug offenses, with the average age of first contact with drugs being just 15.9 years. Alarmingly, over 40% of drug abusers began using substances before turning 18, and homes are frequently cited as primary locations for drug use. This situation underscores the critical role that family and educational institutions must play in combating the spread of misinformation related to drug policies worldwide. The insights were shared during Episode 27 of \"Frontline 2023/2024.\""

The areas covered included Tampines Street 43, where 469g of heroin, 42g of Ice, 18g of cannabis, cash amounting to $4786.20, and various drug paraphernalia were seized from a residential unit. Forced entry was effected when the occupant refused lawful orders to open the door, and a 61-year-old man was arrested for suspected drug trafficking offences. Under Section 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973, it is an offence for a person, on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore, to traffic in a controlled drug, offer to traffic in a controlled drug; or to do or offer to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a controlled drug.

The individual is being escorted by two CNB officers, clad in black tactical attire, indicative of their role in law enforcement. In the background, a CNB vehicle is parked, likely used for transport during this operation. Notably, the grassy landscape also features blue and green rubbish bins, common in residential areas in Singapore. The operation, part of a larger crackdown that resulted in multiple arrests and significant drug seizures, underscores the ongoing efforts to combat drug trafficking in the region.

These drugs have an estimated street value of about $354,000.On 8 May, six youths, aged between 17 and 21, were arrested in a residential unit in the vicinity of Bedok South Avenue 2 for suspected drug abuse. Another four youths were arrested for suspected drug trafficking offences in a hotel in the vicinity of North Bridge Road on 11 May. Superintendent Christopher Lee, Commanding Officer of CNB Enforcement A and E Divisions, said of the island-wide operation: During this series of anti-drug operations, CNB arrested groups of youths who are suspected to have abused drugs in a friends home or in a hotel room. The 2022 Health and Lifestyle Survey conducted by the Institute of Mental Health has found that residences - ones own home or a friends home - were the most commonly cited locations for drug consumption. The survey has also found that for those who abused drugs, the mean age of onset of drug abuse was 15.9 and 52% of these abusers started out with cannabis. It is crucial for parents and family members to be vigilant to warning signs of drug abuse and help their child seek help early.

Officers raided a unit and arrested a 32-year-old man and a 22-year-old woman. About 345g of Ice, 778g of cannabis, 235g of ketamine, 41 Ecstasy tablets, 100 Erimin-5 tablets, 50 LSD stamps, and various drug paraphernalia were recovered. A large number of weapons including an airsoft pistol, machetes, swords, and knuckle dusters were also seized. During the course of the operation, another 32-year-old man was arrested near Bukit Timah. 5g of Ice and drug paraphernalia were recovered from him. The total seizure of 350g of Ice and 778g of cannabis can feed the addiction of about 310 abusers for a week. Deputy Director of Intelligence Division stated that the operation on 13 March is an example of the dangers that officers face every day. Drug traffickers may be armed, increasing the risk to officers. But this will not deter CNB officers from remaining steadfast in efforts to prevent drugs from flowing to the streets. Investigations into the drug activities of all arrested suspects are ongoing, and the Police are investigating the 32-year-old man arrested near Ubi Ave 1 for possession of offensive weapons.",

Our officers have been diligent in following up on all drug leads, and we will spare no effort to track down both drug traffickers and drug abusers. Investigations into the drug activities of all arrested suspects are ongoing.",

The man is dressed in a light, button-up shirt and light-colored trousers, with a stylish sling bag across his chest, while the woman wears a fitted black outfit and exhibits a confident demeanor. \n\nThe second scene features two women in an indoor setting, possibly a medical or operational area, adorned with protective masks and attire. One woman, dressed in a grey top, stands beside equipment, including a box and a black device on the table, likely related to the Central Narcotics Bureau\u2019s efforts. The image reflects a blend of action and serious undertones central to the narrative of drug enforcement, aligning with the theme of \"The Takedown\". No people can be seen in the background of either scene, focusing solely on the characters at the forefront."

The building showcases a prominent sign that reads \"CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU,\" indicative of its key role in maintaining public safety. The architecture reflects a typical administrative structure, with a simple yet functional design, featuring a beige exterior and a sloped roof. A classic white sedan is parked in the foreground, while a secondary vehicle is partially visible, suggesting activity related to the bureau's operations. Although the image captures the bureau's physical presence, no individuals are visible, creating an emphasis on the institution itself. This agency plays a crucial part in Singapore's mission to remain drug-free, marking its significance in the country's law enforcement framework."

The central theme revolves around identifying engaging elements from the film, indicated in the lower images, which depict a scene with individuals interacting. \n\nIn the visual frames, one person in a black vest appears to assist another, likely simulating a situation involving law enforcement or drug-related themes. The attire suggests an undercover or tactical role, aligning with the CNB's operations in Singapore, known for combatting drug-related crimes. The scenes imply dynamic interactions where characters may be either questioning or possibly apprehending individuals, providing a portrayal consistent with CNB operations. \n\nOverall, there are no visible identifiers in the scene; it maintains a focus on cinematic interaction rather than people. This overview emphasizes the role of the CNB and adds context to the participants' quiz experience without revealing identities."

Other illicit medicines were also found in the parcel. CNBOnTheMove: This detection prompted a follow-up operation by CNB officers, and the intended recipient of the parcel, a 30-year-old female Singapore Permanent Resident, was arrested in the vicinity of Beach Road. Two other Singaporean males (aged 62 and 25) were also arrested for suspected drug-related offences. The three suspects were escorted to their hideout, an apartment in the same vicinity. During a search of the apartment, other illicit medicines were found from within and HSA was alerted. Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing. DidYouKnow: Fentanyl is known to be a very potent opioid, approximately 50-100 times more potent than morphine. The abuse of fentanyl results in similar effects to other opioids, such as nausea, drowsiness, respiratory depression, low blood pressure and slow heart rate.

On 1 March, ICA officers from Changi Airfreight Centre, Air Cargo Command noticed anomalies in the scanned images of a parcel declared as medicine from Vietnam. 200 vials believed to contain about 20mg of fentanyl were uncovered. Other illicit medicines were also found in the parcel. CNBOnTheMove: This detection prompted a follow-up operation by CNB officers, and the intended recipient of the parcel was arrested in the vicinity of Beach Road. Two other Singaporean males were also arrested for suspected drug-related offences. The three suspects were escorted to their hideout, an apartment in the same vicinity. During a search of the apartment, other illicit medicines were found, and HSA was alerted. Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing. DidYouKnow: Fentanyl is known to be a very potent opioid, approximately 50-100 times more potent than morphine. The abuse of fentanyl results in similar effects to other opioids, such as nausea, drowsiness, respiratory depression, low blood pressure, and slow heart rate. Due to its potency, fentanyl abuse brings with it a heightened risk of death as a result of overdosing and there have been many cases in overseas jurisdictions of overdose deaths relating to fentanyl and its derivatives. CNB would like to remind the public that fentanyl and its derivatives are listed as Class A controlled drugs under Singapore's Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA).

The international drug scene remains of concern too. There is a strong push by parties with vested interests for more liberal drug policies. Global methamphetamine seizures reached a record high, and there are indications of increased trafficking in Southeast Asia. Methamphetamine has been the most commonly abused drug in Singapore since 2015. The Singapore drug control strategy is a comprehensive one that tackles both drug supply and demand through preventive drug education (PDE), tough anti-drug laws, vigorous enforcement, and effective rehabilitation and aftercare. Despite challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, CNB conducted intensive enforcement operations dismantling 24 drug syndicates, and together with various Home Team agencies, conducted over 500 operations to intercept drugs entering Singapore. COVID-19 did not put a stop to CNBs PDE efforts as the first line of defence against drugs as well. CNB continued with our outreach by taking community engagement events, and PDE talks online, as well as offering the live-streaming of PDE skits to schools. Drug abuse exacts a high cost on abusers, their families, and ultimately society. Livelihoods are lost, relationships are destroyed, children suffer and the wider community too, because of drug-related crimes. Singapore hence adopts a harm-prevention approach to drugs, aimed at preventing the harms that drugs bring to individuals, families and society. CNB stands together with the community, and will continue to keep Singapore drug-free for our future generations.",
