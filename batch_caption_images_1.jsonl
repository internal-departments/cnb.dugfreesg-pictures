Based on information received from Integrated Targeting Centre, the man was referred for enhanced checks at Woodlands Checkpoint on 22 December 2025. ICA officers uncovered two black bundles believed to contain controlled drugs in the bag. CNB officers were immediately alerted to the detection and conducted further checks. A total of 7 bundles believed to contain controlled drugs were found. The bundles contained about 3,272g of cannabis and 1,709g of Ice. The drugs seized have an estimated worth of more than $237,000 and could potentially feed the addiction of about 1,440 abusers for a week. Investigations are ongoing. Under Section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973, those who import into or export from Singapore more than 250g of methamphetamine, or 500g of cannabis, may face the death penalty. CNB will continue to work with ICA to prevent attempts to smuggle drugs across our borders.\n"}]}]}}

The drugs seized are estimated to be worth more than $892,000. The heroin, Ice and cannabis seized could potentially feed the addiction of 2,873 abusers for a week. Some of the areas covered during this island-wide operation included Bedok, Bugis, Bukit Batok, Geylang, Jurong, Sembawang and Yishun. On 13 November, CNB officers launched an operation at a residential unit near Yishun Ring Road which saw the arrest of a 36-year-old Singaporean man for suspected drug-related offences. Cash amounting to SGD5,322.90, MYR442.05, BND155 and THB5 were later seized from the man. CNB officers then searched the man's car, where vape-related products including 304 e-vaporisers and 1,337 e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate were seized. Also on 13 November, CNB officers raided a residential unit near Jurong East Avenue, arresting four Singaporeans, a 53-year-old woman for suspected drug trafficking offences and three men, aged 61, 65 and 67 for suspected drug abuse. About 1,031g of heroin, 131g of Ice, 121g of Ecstasy tablets, one Erimin-5 tablet, drug paraphernalia and cash amounting to SGD6,067 were seized from the unit.\n"}]}]}}

A total of about 4,354g of heroin, 1,225g of cannabis, 1,092g of Ice, 135g of Ecstasy tablets, one Erimin-5 tablet, one bottle of methadone, small amount of ketamine and numerous vape-related products including 316 e-vaporisers and 1,342 e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate were seized. The drugs seized are estimated to be worth more than $892,000. The heroin, Ice and cannabis seized could potentially feed the addiction of 2,873 abusers for a week. Some of the areas covered during this island-wide operation included Bedok, Bugis, Bukit Batok, Geylang, Jurong, Sembawang and Yishun. On 13 November, CNB officers launched an operation at a residential unit near Yishun Ring Road which saw the arrest of a 36-year-old Singaporean man for suspected drug-related offences. Cash amounting to SGD5,322.90, MYR442.05, BND155 and THB5 were later seized from the man. CNB officers then searched the man's car, where vape-related products including 304 e-vaporisers and 1,337 e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate were seized. Also on 13 November, CNB officers raided a residential unit near Jurong East Avenue, arresting four Singaporeans, a 53-year-old woman for suspected drug trafficking offences and three men, aged 61, 65 and 67 for suspected drug abuse. About 1,031g of heroin, 131g of Ice, 121g of Ecstasy tablets, one Erimin-5 tablet, drug paraphernalia and cash amounting to SGD6,067 were seized from the unit.

One location was near Yishun Ring Road, where a 42-year-old man was arrested at his residential unit for suspected drug offences, with numerous vape-related products and SGD3,900 in cash seized. Officers conducted a follow-up search of the rubbish chute linked to the unit and recovered a total of about 109 e-vaporiser pods and 11 e-vaporisers believed to contain etomidate. The other operation was launched at a residential unit near Fernvale Lane, where a 31-year-old woman was arrested for suspected drug offences. Officers seized numerous vaping products including six e-vaporiser pods and two e-vaporisers believed to contain etomidate and SGD1,024.20 in cash from within the unit and the woman\u2019s belongings. Under Section 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973, it is an offence for a person, on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore, to traffic in a controlled drug, offer to traffic in a controlled drug; or to do or offer to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a controlled drug.

The drugs seized are estimated to be worth more than $68,000. The heroin, Ice and cannabis seized could potentially feed the addiction of 436 abusers for a week. Areas covered during this island-wide operation included Ang Mo Kio, Balestier, Clementi, Punggol, Woodlands and Yishun. On 13 October, CNB officers intercepted a motorcycle at a junction along Yishun Avenue 1 and arrested a suspect for suspected drug trafficking offences. A search of the man and the motorcycle found a total of about 2,369g of cannabis, 156g of ketamine, 11g of Ice, 11g of Ecstasy, 40 Erimin-5 tablets, and drug paraphernalia. On the same evening, CNB officers launched a follow-up operation near Compassvale Walk and arrested a suspect for suspected drug trafficking offences. Drug paraphernalia were seized from the residence in Punggol. Separately, on 15 October, CNB officers launched an operation near Clementi Avenue 1 and arrested a suspect for suspected drug trafficking offences.

A total of about 351g of heroin, 99g of Ice, 69g of cannabis, 10g of ketamine, one Ecstasy tablet, one bottle of methadone, numerous vape-related products including 527 e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate and cash amounting to $4,228.70 were seized. The drugs seized are estimated to be worth more than $74,000. The heroin, Ice and cannabis seized can potentially feed the addiction of 235 abusers for a week. Drug trafficking suspects were arrested from various locations across a few days. On 21 and 24 September, CNB officers raided residential units near New Bridge Road and Champions Way. About 106g of heroin and 26g of Ice were recovered from the unit at New Bridge Road, while 143g of heroin, 18g of Ice, 65g of cannabis and 10g of ketamine were seized from the latter. On 25 September, CNB officers raided residential units near Hougang Street 51 and Buangkok Crescent, where two male drug trafficking suspects aged 28 and 29 were arrested. Numerous vape-related products including 524 e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate, and cash including $3,500 were seized from within the Hougang unit. The 29-year-old was seen discarding items out of his unit's bedroom window prior to arrest. Upon retrieval, the items were found to be vape-related products, including one e-vaporiser pod believed to contain etomidate. Under the MDA, those who import, sell or distribute etomidate-laced e-vaporisers will face prosecution. Investigations into all arrested suspects are ongoing.\n"}]}]}}

CNB officers were immediately alerted to conduct further checks, which uncovered an additional six black bundles hidden in various compartments of the car.

Numerous vape-related products including more than 400 e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate, and cash including SGD20,818, RMB498 and MYR5,800 were seized. CNB officers arrested two men (aged 26 and 28) at a void deck of a residential block near Telok Blangah Rise for suspected drug offences, with both suspects physically resisting arrest and had to be subdued by officers. 68 and five e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate were recovered from the 26-year-old and 28-year-old respectively, with preliminary investigations indicating the men were conducting a drug transaction prior to the arrest. The suspects were then escorted to a unit in the same block where two additional men (aged 26 and 23) were arrested, and a search yielded 327 more e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate. Four other Singaporeans were arrested in separate CNB operations the same evening for suspected drug offences. Two men (aged 29 and 32) were arrested near Hougang Avenue 9, with officers seizing vape products and significant cash totalling SGD20,818, RMB498, and MYR5,800 from their unit. At Boon Lay Drive, a 23-year-old man was arrested at his residence where five e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate were found, followed by the arrest of an 18-year-old woman outside the unit who was carrying one etomidate pod and had reportedly planned to collect drugs from the man. Under the MDA, those who import, sell or distribute etomidate-laced e-vaporisers will face prosecution. Investigations into the drug activities of the arrested suspects are ongoing.\n"}]}]}}
