The drugs seized, estimated to be worth about $1.4 million, could feed the addiction of 6,200 drug abusers for a week. In the evening hours of 7 November, a 32-year-old man was arrested at the void deck of a residential block near Plantation Crescent while a residential unit of the same block was raided and a 44-year-old man and a 31-year-old woman within the unit were arrested. All three are Singaporeans. About 1,027g of cannabis and 513g of Ice were recovered from the 32-year-old man and a search of the unit led to the recovery of about 3,223g of cannabis, 7,626g of heroin, 2,339g of Ice, 235g of Ecstasy, five bottles of methadone, 2,590 Erimin-5 tablets and cash amounting to $9,250. A subsequent search of a car that was driven by the 44-year-old man found 95g of cannabis, 477g of heroin, 169g of Ice and three bottles of methadone.DAC Aaron Tang, Director of Intelligence Division, said: The efforts of the CNB officers in this operation had prevented a large haul of drugs from flowing into the streets, which if not stopped, would have impacted the lives of thousands of individuals.

We wanted to see if we could build a game that would help players empathise with the vulnerability of falling into substance abuse and addiction, with the aid of VR technology. However, all this would not have been possible without the story. While crafting the story, the team had many discussions on what we should focus on, be it pre- or post-abuse. We also considered the perspectives of abusers. Ultimately, we want to convey to our audience that prevention is better than cure, and inspire a sense of hope for those who wish to break free from addiction.

Hear what inspired them to develop Man in the Mirror and contribute to the drug-free cause! The team wanted something different from existing efforts. We wanted to see if we could build a game that would help players empathise with the vulnerability of falling into substance abuse and addiction, with the aid of VR technology. However, all this would not have been possible without the story. While crafting the story, the team had many discussions on what we should focus on, be it pre- or post-abuse. We also considered the perspectives of abusers. Ultimately, we want to convey to our audience that prevention is better than cure, and inspire a sense of hope for those who wish to break free from addiction. ICYMI: The giveaway contest on Facebook is still ongoing till 4 June 2021! Like, comment a screenshot of the Man in the Mirror on your mobile devices, and hashtag DrugFreeSG for a chance to win a customised VR cardboard headset!",

During a search of the apartment, other illicit medicines were found from within and HSA was alerted. Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing. DidYouKnow: Fentanyl is known to be a very potent opioid, approximately 50-100 times more potent than morphine. The abuse of fentanyl results in similar effects to other opioids, such as nausea, drowsiness, respiratory depression, low blood pressure and slow heart rate. Due to its potency, fentanyl abuse brings with it a heightened risk of death as a result of overdosing and there have been many cases in overseas jurisdictions of overdose deaths relating to fentanyl and its derivatives.CNB would like to remind the public that fentanyl and its derivatives are listed as Class A controlled drugs under Singapores Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA). The possession, consumption, importation or trafficking of any controlled drug is an offence under the MDA.",
