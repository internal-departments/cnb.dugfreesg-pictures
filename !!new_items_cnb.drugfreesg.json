        "caption": "#: -- ; A 39-year-old Malaysian man was arrested for attempting to smuggle drugs, including about 3,272g of cannabis and 1,709g of Ice, through Woodlands Checkpoint. Based on information received from Integrated Targeting Centre, the Malaysian man was referred for enhanced checks at Woodlands Checkpoint on 22 December 2025. ICA officers uncovered two black bundles believed to contain controlled drugs in the mans bag. CNB officers were immediately alerted to the detection and conducted further checks. A total of 7 bundles believed to contain controlled drugs were found. The bundles contained about 3,272g of cannabis and 1,709g of Ice. The drugs seized have an estimated worth of more than $237,000 and could potentially feed the addiction of about 1,440 abusers for a week.Investigations are ongoing. Under Section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973, those who import into or export from Singapore more than 250g of methamphetamine, or 500g of cannabis, may face the death penalty. CNB will continue to work with ICA to prevent attempts to smuggle drugs across our borders.Full story .drugfreesg linkinbio"

A total of about 2,504g of cannabis, 158g of ketamine, 76g of heroin, 73g of Ice, 12g of Ecstasy, 40 Erimin-5 tablets and numerous vape related products including 42 e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate were seized. The drugs seized are estimated to be worth more than $68,000. The heroin, Ice and cannabis seized could potentially feed the addiction of 436 abusers for a week. Areas covered during this island-wide operation included Ang Mo Kio, Balestier, Clementi, Punggol, Woodlands and Yishun. On 13 October, CNB officers intercepted a motorcycle at a junction along Yishun Avenue 1 and arrested a 36-year-old Singaporean male rider, for suspected drug trafficking offences. A search of the man and the motorcycle found a total of about 2,369g of cannabis, 156g of ketamine, 11g of Ice, 11g of Ecstasy, 40 Erimin-5 tablets, and drug paraphernalia. On the same evening, CNB officers launched a follow-up operation near Compassvale Walk and arrested a 27-year-old Singaporean man for suspected drug trafficking offences. Drug paraphernalia were seized from the males residence in Punggol. Separately, on 15 October, CNB officers launched an operation near Clementi Avenue 1 and arrested a 26-year-old Singaporean woman for suspected drug trafficking offences. The woman was with her 19-month-old daughter during the arrest. A search of the woman found a total of 7 e-vaporiser pods and 2 e-vaporisers believed to contain etomidate. Appropriate arrangements were made to ensure that the welfare of the child was taken care of. Full story .drugfreesg linkinbio"

Close cooperation and timely exchange of intelligence between the agencies enabled the operation.In April 2025, CNB received information concerning freight parcels suspected to be carrying controlled drugs which were transiting through Singapore, and were believed to have originated from the United States and bound for New Zealand. The parcels were intercepted by CNB and found to contain more than 10kg of Ice, or methamphetamine. Through follow-up investigations, CNB identified other similar parcels bound for New Zealand and Australia. Acting on this intelligence provided by CNB, New Zealand Customs intercepted two drug-laden parcels in April 2025 and June 2025, leading to a total seizure of 10kg of methamphetamine, with an estimated street value of NZ$3 million. Additional intelligence sharing with the AFP and ABF led to the Australian authorities intercepting and seizing multiple consignments in May 2025 which in total contained about 40kg of methamphetamine and had an estimated street value of AUD$37 million, destined for Australia. The illicit substances were concealed inside furniture, mixed coffee and mustard shipments. The international drug syndicate is currently under investigation in the United States. Based on the investigation so far, DEA investigators believe that the methamphetamine originated from Mexico and was imported into the United States for delivery into more lucrative markets in the Asia-Pacific region.Full story .drugfreesg linkinbio"

Numerous vape-related products including more than 400 e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate, and cash including SGD20,818, RMB498 and MYR5,800 were seized.CNB officers arrested two men (aged 26 and 28) at a void deck of a residential block near Telok Blangah Rise for suspected drug offences, with both suspects physically resisting arrest and had to be subdued by officers. 68 and five e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate were recovered from the 26-year-old and 28-year-old respectively, with preliminary investigations indicating the men were conducting a drug transaction prior to the arrest. The suspects were then escorted to a unit in the same block where two additional men (aged 26 and 23) were arrested, and a search yielded 327 more e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate.Four other Singaporeans were arrested in separate CNB operations the same evening for suspected drug offences. Two men (aged 29 and 32) were arrested near Hougang Avenue 9, with officers seizing vape products and significant cash totalling SGD20,818, RMB498, and MYR5,800 from their unit. At Boon Lay Drive, a 23-year-old man was arrested at his residence where five e-vaporiser pods believed to contain etomidate were found, followed by the arrest of an 18-year-old woman outside the unit who was carrying one etomidate pod and had reportedly planned to collect drugs from the man.Under the MDA, those who import, sell or distribute etomidate-laced e-vaporisers will face prosecution. Investigations into the drug activities of the arrested suspects are ongoing.Full story .drugfreesg linkinbio"

A total of about 1,050g of Ice, 100 Erimin-5 tablets, 9g of Ecstasy, and various drug paraphernalia were seized. The drugs seized are estimated to be worth more than $128,000 and could potentially feed the addiction of 600 abusers for a week.In the morning on 14 August, a 42-year-old Singaporean man was arrested in his residential unit near Tampines Street 86 for suspected drug offences. During the raid, CNB officers found multiple drug paraphernalia under the coffee table in the living room. The mans 10-year-old daughter was also present. In the afternoon of the same day, a 41-year-old Singaporean man was arrested in a residential unit near Jalan Kayu for suspected drug trafficking offences. During the search of the unit, officers recovered about 158g of Ice and 9g of Ecstasy. At around the same time, CNB officers raided another residential unit near Bukit Batok West Avenue 9, where a 36-year-old man was arrested for suspected drug trafficking offences.
